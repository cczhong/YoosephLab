## I. Gene Finding
##================
## Gene caller options
## Currently, SPA supports the following gene callers. 
## 0:FragGeneScan(FGS), 1:MetaGeneAnnotator(MGA)
gene	0

##------------------------
## 1. FragGeneScan options
##------------------------
## The following three options are used for ORF call with FGS and filtering FGS output.
## If MGA is used, these options are are disregared.
## FGS  complete genomic sequence option (0:short sequences, 1:complete genomic sequences)
complete	0
## FGS train option (complete, sanger_5, sanger_10, 454_10, 454_30, illumina_5, or illumina_10)
train	454_10
## Filter out FGS ORF prediction with indels (1:true or 0:false).
dropindel	0

##----------------------------
## 2. MetaGeneAnnotator option
##----------------------------
## MGA genome option (s:single genome, m:metagenome)
## If FGS is used, this option is disregarded.
mga	m

## Number of CPUs 
## ORFs can be called in parallel. Increase CPU size to speed up this stage.
ncpu	4


##=============
## II. Assembly
##=============
## Size of kmer
kmer	5

## Paired-end read (1:true or 0:false)
## Curently, SPA supports pair-end reads only for Illumina platform.
paired	0

## Graph trimming (1:true or 0:false)
## Trim vertices/edges with low coverage
trim	0

## Minimum kmer coverage for trimming graph
## Vertices and edges with lower coverage than the following value are trimmed. 
## If trim option is off, this option is ignored.
min-coverage	1

## Minimum number of same reads in a neighboring node.
## Sharing reads between current and neighboring nodes with lower than the following support are ignored.
min-share	1

## Maximum distant node in a path to find same reads in a current node
distance	20

## Minimum base coverage in consensus
## Leading and trailing bases with lower than the folllowing coverage are trimmed from a consensus sequence.
base-depth	1

## Median base depth in consensus
## A path with lower than the following median base depth is discarded.
med-coverage	1

## Top x% percentile of seed kmers
## Path search utilizes top x% of seed kmers.
percentile	50

## Generate profile output (1:true or 0:false).
profile	0

## Generate alignment output (1:true of 0:false).
alignment	0

## Verbosity (1:true or 0:false)
verbose	0

##=====================
## III. Post processing
##=====================
## Post-processing gene caller (0:FragGeneScan, 1:MetaGeneAnnotator, 2:Both)
## Same gene finder is recommened used in the gene finding stage.
post	0

## Mininum length of sequence length
## Sequences with shorter the follwing length are ignored.
length	60
