# This is a sample parameter sheet for running HMM-GRASPx.
#
# Note that this sheet is optional, and if not provided HMM-GRASPx will be run with default parameters.
#
# Also note that the sample sheet only contains a subset (important ones) of tunable parameters,
#   and you can check out other options with the '--help' option while running individual executables.
