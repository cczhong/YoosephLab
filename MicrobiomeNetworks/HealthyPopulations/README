Scripts and data for "Bacterial associations in the healthy human gut microbiome across populations":

~ Note: 
	1) Download the entire HealthyPopulations folder
	2) Make sure to unzip all files in all subfolders that are zipped. If you do not do this some scripts will break.
	3) All input and ouput files can be found in the subfolders. If you wish you can go straight to them.


Python Notebook Scripts:

	Cohort Sample Information Notebook): Contains sample read count information and subject sex and age metadata.

	Part 1): This notebook produces the species/genus and prevalence filtered sample-taxa dataframes.

	Part 2): In this notebook you will see the prevalence of bacteria, the highly prevalent (>90% sample prevalence) species total sample relative abundances,
		PCA and PCoA of sample relative abundance profiles.

	Part 3.1 and 3.2): In notebook part 3.1 you will find the scripts for producing networks from partial correlations matrices, measuring network properties, generating random networks,
	measuring the edges that are shared across networks, etc. In notebook 3.2 we take the random networks we built in 3.1 and produce pvalues for the properties of our networks.

	Part 4): The part 4 notebook shows how we produced species functional profiles.

	Part 5): This notebook holds the scripts for "Hub" and "Bottleneck" analysis as well as part of the module functional cluster analysis, and the scatter/lineregress plots of the species partner 
	genome functional distance vs association weight. 

	Part 6): This is notebook contains how we generated dataframes to be filled from featureCount output along with results from CheckM analysis.

	Part 7): This notebook contains the PCA of TIGRFAMS contained within each cohort's sample reads.
