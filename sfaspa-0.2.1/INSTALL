The following Perl libraries need to be installed.

- Set::Scalar
- Getopt::Long
- Time::HiRes
- constant
- Statistics::Lite
- POSIX
- File::Basename
- File::Spec

Most of above perl libraries are pre-installed with perl 5.
Any uninstalled library will be installed with perl_libs.sh
during installation.
perl_libs.sh requires root previledge to install libraries.
If you do not have root permission, install them mannually.
