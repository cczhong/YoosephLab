The following three genomes were used for examle reads.
Accession	Genome
NC_004606	Streptococcus_pyogenes_SSI_1_uid57895
NC_004070	Streptococcus_pyogenes_MGAS315_uid57911
NC_003485	Streptococcus_pyogenes_MGAS8232_uid57871
For each genome, 100 bp paired-end reads were generated using wgsim with no sequencing error and 20x genomic coverage.
Then, reads from three genomes were combined in a singe FASTA file.
